I developed this code as part of my masters thesis (http://www.cs.stanford.edu/~saswat/research/one.pdf). 
A succinct description of the work appears this paper: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Ekhoosc/papers/icfp2001.ps
The initial version of this code was enhanced and extended by somebody in our group. I dont know who, thanks to him/her!

To invoke the system without GUI
================================
You can either click the inter.bat file or 
at DOS command window, type 
	inter

To test technical indicator without GUI
=======================================
type
	evalDisplay <technical_indicator> <companyname>
for example,
	evalDisplay (expMovingAvg 5 ((low+high)/2)) "asa.n.sum"

To search for pattern instances without GUI
===========================================
For one company, type 
	doComp <pattern> <companyname>
for example,
	doComp hill "asa.n.sum"

For multiple companies, type
	allComps <pattern> "coms.txt"
where the file "coms.txt" contains all the companies you are interested in.

---------------------------------------------------------------
To invoke the system with GUI
=============================
You can either click the CPL.bat file or
at DOS command window, type
	java CPL

I feel the current GUI is reasonably friendly - no further explanation is needed. :-)
But feel free to email me if you have any question.
